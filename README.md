# Arslan-Soomro.github.io
My Personal Portfolio website

- Include Full URLS e.g. https://qaj.vercel.app instead of qaj.vercel.app in your projects website, the href attribute of anchor tag mistakenly 
takes you to arslan-soomro.github.io/qaj.vercel.app if full URLS are not used, hence the visitor sees a 404 page on github by clicking the preview button on the project card,
avoid it by using full urls
